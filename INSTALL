PAToS INSTALLATION GUIDE
========================

Requirments
-----------
To use PATOs, the following is required:

- PERL (I used version 5.12.4)
- VISLCG3 (a.k.a. CG3; use the latest version, see 
  http://www.divvun.no/doc/tools/docu-vislcg3.html)
- bash scripting language
- latex (optional, see below)

If you want to be able to generate a PDF file with the rule specifications 
using the documentation syntax proposed in the CG3 grammar you will need
LaTeX (a document markup language for TeX typesetting, see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX).

Installation
------------

1) Download the code in the repository in a folder of your choice. This
 will be the $SPINTX_HOME. After downloading the code from github, this 
 folder should now have a "spintxPedagogicalAnntotation" folder.

2) Create a $SPINTX_HOME environment variable in your .profile file
 (unix-like systems). Add this line to the file:

     export SPINTX_HOME=/Users/mquixal/Documents/Feina/COERLL/dev/

3) Ensure that all the programms required can be executed from the
 command line. Add this line to ~/.profile:

     export PATH=[The/Home/Folder/For/PAToS]/bin:$PATH

Note: it is often the case that there is already a line similar to the previous 
doing the same for other paths. If this is the case, just add the new path to 
the corresponding line and do not delete any of the existing paths. Be sure to 
end with no slash and with a colon, as in the example. After adding the line 
run source .profile or restart the terminal window.

4) Create a directory called "corpus" in $SPINTX_HOME, sister to "spintxPedagogicalAnntotation".

    mkdir corpus

Under corpus create the following folders too:

    mkdir ori cg3 cqp out wla stats

5) See USAGE file.
