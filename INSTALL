PAToS INSTALLATION GUIDE
========================

To use PATOs, the following is required:

Requirments
-----------
To use PATOs, the following is required:

- PERL (I used version 5.12.4)
- VISLCG3 (a.k.a. CG3; use the latest version)
- bash scripting language
- latex (optionally, see below)

If you want to be able to generate a PDF file with the rule specifications 
using the documentation syntax proposed in the CG3 grammar you will need
LaTeX (a document markup language for TeX typesetting, see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX).

Installation
------------

1) Download the code in the repository in a folder of your choice.
2) Create a $SPINTX_HOME environment variable in your .profile file
 (unix-like systems).
3) Ensure that all the programms required can be executed from the
 command line.
