PAToS BASIC COMMAND LINE ORDERS
===============================

See docs/PATos-DataFlowDiagram.odg for a graphical representation of
PAToS data flow.

NOTE: before executing any script you need to be sure that the folder
 $SPINTX_HOME/data/ClipTags contains at least one *.txt file using the 
 latest SPinTX project format for tagged and lemmatized files. See
 https://github.com/coerll/SpinTXCorpusData

ProcessSPinTX.sh
----------------
This script executes all the scripts and processess needed to generate:
   a) the pedagogically annotated files ($SPINTX_HOME/data/ClipPedagogicalTags)
   b) the clip (or file) level breakdown of occurring pedagogical phenomena
     ($SPINTX_HOME/data/stats)
   c) the word level stand-off annotations list in JSON format
     ($SPINTX_HOME/data/ClipsWLA)
   d) It also generate a series of tables in *.tsv format that include in one
     single file the information generated for the clip and the word level

 - EXECUTION
   command_line$ ProcessSPinTX.sh help
    -> provides a mini help page
   
   command_line$ ProcessSPinTX.sh all
    -> executes all processess

   command_line$ ProcessSPinTX.sh cg3 (or cg3trace)
    -> executes only vislcg3 with SpintxGrammar.rle in $SPINTX_HOME/tools/grammar
    -> cg3 orders simple, standard execution
    -> cg3trace keeps track of which rules are being applied for each annotation (this
       is useful for grammar developers)

 - OUTPUT (it has several output files and these can be obtained upon demand,
   but these are the most useful):
    
    WORD LEVEL - one file per clip
	- *.cg3 files in $SPINTX_HOME/data/cg3/ folder
	  These are the files that are the actual input to the whole process. 
	  They are SPinTX tree-tagged files in CG3 format.
	- *.out files in $SPINTX_HOME/data/ClipPedagogicalTags/ folder
	  These are the files that result from applying our CG3-based pedagogical 
	  annotation grammar to the *.cg3 files
	- *.wla.json files in $SPINTX_HOME/data/ClipsWLA folder
	  These are the files for the visual/activity enhancment of clip transcriptions
	  (or in general texts) in the Corpus to Classroom website of the SPinTX project
    
    WORD LEVEL - one file for the whole corpus
	- TokenTagsPedagogical.tsv in $SPINTX_HOME/corpus/ClipsWLA folder
	  This is a file that contains the pedagogical annotations for 
	  visual/activity enhancement for all the clips in a given corpus
	- TokenTagsPedagogical.json (the same in json format)

    CLIP LEVEL
	- ClipMetadataPedagogical.tsv (which is in fact a merge from 
	  SpintxPedagogicalMetadata.tsv and SpintxMetadataVocab.tsv, 
	  both in $SPINTX_HOME/corpus/out/). 
	  The two previous files contain the clip level information (which 
	  relates each clip with a given pedagogical phenomenon). The 
	  information at the level of vocabulary is separated from the other 
	  types of informations because of the way it was originally 
	  implemented, not for any fundamental reason.
