PAToS BASIC COMMAND LINE ORDERS
===============================

See docs/PATos-DataFlowDiagram.odg for a graphical representation of
PAToS data flow.

NOTE: before executing any script you need to be sure that the folder
 $SPINTX_HOME/corpus/ori contains at least one *.txt file using the 
 SPinTX project format for tagged and lemmatized files.

ProcessSPinTX.sh
----------------
This script executes all the scripts and processess needed to generate:
   a) the pedagogically annotated files ($SPINTX_HOME/corpus/out)
   b) the clip (or file) level breakdown of occurring pedagogical phenomena
     ($SPINTX_HOME/corpus/stats)
   c) the word level stand-off annotations list in JSON format
     ($SPINTX_HOME/corpus/ClipsWLA)

 - EXECUTION
   command_line$ ProcessSPinTX.sh help
    -> provides a mini help page
   
   command_line$ ProcessSPinTX.sh all
    -> executes all processess

 - OUTPUT (it has several output files and these can be obtained upon demand,
   but these are the most useful):
    
    WORD LEVEL - one file per clip
	- *.cg3 files in $SPINTX_HOME/corpus/cg3/ folder
	  These are the files that are the actual input to the whole process. They are SPinTX tree-tagged files in CG3 format.
	- *.out files in $SPINTX_HOME/corpus/out/ folder
	  These are the files that result from applying our CG3-based pedagogical annotation grammar to the *.cg3 files
	- *.wla.json files in $SPINTX_HOME/corpus/ClipsWLA folder
	  These are the files for the visual/activity enhancment of clip transcriptions (or in general texts) in the Corpus to Classroom website of the SPinTX project
    
    WORD LEVEL - one file for the whole corpus
	- ClipsWLAOneFile.csv in $SPINTX_HOME/corpus/ClipsWLA folder
	  This is a file that contains the pedagogical annotations for visual/activity enhancement for all the clips in a given corpus

    CLIP LEVEL
	- SpintxPedagogicalMetadata.csv in $SPINTX_HOME/corpus/out/
	- SpintxMetadataVocab.csv in $SPINTX_HOME/corpus/out/
	  The two previous files contain the clip level information (which relates each clip with a given pedagogical phenomenon). The information at the level of vocabulary is separated from the other types of informations because of the way it was originally implemented, not for any fundamental reason.
