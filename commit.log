- Update grammar documentation in PDF doc.

JULY 11
-------
- Minor changes in scripts to adapt to column names in Google Fusion tables

JULY 9, 2013
------------
- Added some comments to ProcessSPinTX.sh for documentation purposes
- Added a patch to add gender Fem or Masc to definite articles el, la, los, las so that CQP does not complain for compilation (this is not of much use to pedagogical annotation right now, but it is for practical purposes when using CQP to inform rule writing)
- Added code to remove older files in folders that should only contain files that result from processing the files in ClipTags (affects cg3, ClipPedagogicalTags and ClipWLA)

- Starting to work on annotation of future (conjugado y de perífrasis)

JULY 8, 2013

JUNE 27, 2013 (bis)
-------------
- Added new PDF documentation of the pedagogical annotation grammar.

JUNE 27, 2013
-----------
- Changed countPedagogicalFeatures.pl to allow for a Func column in ClipPedagogicalMetadata.tsv (as said before this is currently not clean enough and has to be done manually)
- Changed rules that established relations between words occuring further left to words occuring further right. This created weird higlihthings on the web, for instance, in sentence like "Dime, le gusta vivir en Estados Unidosa tu hijo." where the expression "le gusta" is marked as relevant for some grammar points, "le" was marked as the end point and "gusta" as the start point and that would make things weird in displaying.
- Also changed ProcessSPinTX.sh to adapt to the Func annotations. Otherwise the ClipMetadataPedagogical.tsv table was not properly generated.

JUNE 27, 2013
-----------
- Added rules to repair readings for para and creen.
- Added more rules to handle exponents of function for deseos and purposes using para.

JUNE 25, 2013
-----------
- Adapted rule to handle desire expressions using nouns like necesidad de que VERB+MSubj so that there can be a NP or a clitic pronoun between the que and the verb (using the function TEMPLATE of CG3).

JUNE 25, 2013
-----------
- Adding some more rules for handling deseos y recomendaciones.

JUNE 19, 2013
-----------
- Changes in GrammarDocuSPinTX.pl so that it works with the appropriate paths (after slight changes in path names)
- Changes in GrammarDocuSPinTX.pl so that it works out rules that have low long dashes in them like _ (which caused problems in pdflatex compilation for the generation of the PDF documentation of the rules)

JUNE 18, 2013
-----------
- Added rules to handle deseos, recomendaciones and a couple more of functional tags (still underway)

JUNE 17, 2013
-----------
- Rules to handle esto, eso, aquello as pronouns (in fact marked as determiners with a pronominal function, following certain theories that advocate for the inexistence of empty categories).
- Rules to handle "uno" as an indefinite article in as in "uno de sus hermanos".
- Halfway working on the indentification of exponents of function for "expresar deseos y recomendaciones"

JUNE 13, 2013
-----------
- Added rules to handle mandatos informales en singular (tú)

JUNE 12, 2013
-----------
- Added rules to disambiguate dar|decir occurrences of "di" into the dar (to better handle imperativo)
- Changed internal path definitions to work properly with installation in virtual server (basically assumes that there is a SPINTX_HOME variable that has two subfolders data and tools. These two folders contain the rest of files (downloaded mainly from github or processed internally if there is the need)
- Changed the way the CG3 grammar was called by ProcessSPinTX.sh so that it adapts (hopefully seamlessly) to new installations

JUNE 10, 2013

MAY 28, 2013
-----------

- New version of grammard documentation in PDF (see docs folder)
- Repaired bug in formatting of documentation of rule related information
- Repaired bug in annotation of tu as subject pronoun (when it has no tilde it is usually a determiner, unless it is a typo)

- Added some rules to start annotating "ha sido" as a non-auxiliary use of ser if not followed by a participle 

MAY 24, 2013
-----------
- Added script CompileSPinTXInCQP.sh, which compiles the linguistically (not pedagogically) annotated files to CWB assuming this is installed and you know how to work with it
- Modified ttagger2OtherFormats.pl so that it can generate tsv files in ClipCQP folder to work with Corpus WorkBench format
- Updated README.md with instructions on how to use CompileSPinTXInCQP.sh

MAY 23, 2013
-----------
- Adapted scripts to work with github's folder structure
- Changed files with extension solr to extesion pla (stands for Pedagogical List of Annotations). These files are stored in ClipPedagogicalTags (folder in the github repository https://github.com/coerll/SpinTXCorpusData)

-----------
- Updated CG grammar documentation

  What used to be (in *.wla.json files and *.tsv files):

AF002_1989_EP_SU2011_AD_01      Prep    Gram    tt-29   tt-29
AF002_1989_EP_SU2011_AD_01      RecuDiscurso:GanarTiempo        Prag    tt-32   tt-32

AF002_1989_EP_SU2011_AD_01      Prep    Gram    tt-29   tt-29
AF002_1989_EP_SU2011_AD_01      RecuDiscurso    Prag    tt-32   tt-32
AF002_1989_EP_SU2011_AD_01      RecuDiscurso:GanarTiempo        Prag    tt-32   tt-32
- Started writing a new script to generate a CQP formatted file out of the *.out files to allow better searching possibilities to grammar developers (and as a by product for research in linguistics), cg32cqp.pl
- Adapted rules to merge different pedagogical labels used for tagging of constructions with object pronouns to one single label (Gram:Pron:Objeto)

APR 4, 2013
-----------

- Changed all rules with a code such as @:Gram:ExpresarSorpresas:* to Gram:Gustar:Otros (to be coherent with current typology)

- Added rules to annotate present and past subjunctive and the plu- versions (hayas cantado and hubieras cantado)

MAR 28, 2013

MAR 21, 2013

- Upddated PDF doc for rule specificaitons in docs folder under $SPINTX_HOME/spintxPedagogicalAnntotation.
- Changed countPedagogicFeatures.pl to allow for the counting of annotations of the main category Herit (this is kind of ugly, but currently new 1st level classes have to be encoded manually in this one script).
